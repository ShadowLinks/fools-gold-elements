        <description>
            <p> s the foreclaimers are so deeply tied to the lore of the Bellowing Wilds, talk with your GM before creating a foreclaimer character and ways to integrate your foreclaimer character’s backstory into the campaign. Discuss some of the following questions to help integrate your foreclaimer character into a campaign everyone can enjoy: How much of the mystery do you want to preserve? If your GM is planning a game in which uncovering what happened to the foreclaimers will play a major part, then having a living, breathing spoiler walking around isn’t ideal. Consider ways a foreclaimer character might not have all the information in this chapter from the start. Perhaps they were raised outside of foreclaimer culture, have lost their memories, or don’t even know they are a foreclaimer. When is the adventure set? If your game takes place in a version of Ambria set after the events of the original Fool’s Gold campaign or the events of Part 7: Fool’s Gold All QUACKed Up, foreclaimer characters from Seelia could have returned to Ambria. Such games could explore themes of rediscovery and reconciliation. If your game takes place before the potential return of the foreclaimers, consider how a foreclaimer player character arrived in the right place at the right time to take part in the adventure. You and the GM could work on this together, or you could leave it up to the GM to decide, opening up the opportunity of a reveal similar to Gothi’s from the original Fool’s Gold game.</p>
            <h4>DIVINELY CRAFTED BODIES</h4>
            <p>The foreclaimers were originally crafted by the goddess Stella, who patterned them after elves and gifted them with a high level of curiosity. Their distant relation to elves is evident in their features: pointed ears, slender yet muscular physiques, and long lifespans. They’re taller than most elves, typically between six and seven feet tall. Their skin tones are shades of greenish-gray, from the color of light stone to deep, mossy green. Foreclaimers’ hair comes in various textures, typically in muted shades that help them blend in with their jungle home, such as earthy greens, soft blues, and subdued reds.</p>
            <p class="indent"></p>
            <h4>CURIOSITY AND KNOWLEDGE</h4>
            <p>Foreclaimers are voraciously curious about the world and constantly seek to expand their knowledge. They love to offer solutions to problems, whether these are asked for or not. Such behavior is not regarded as rude in foreclaimer society, which values efficiency as the highest virtue.</p>
            <p class="indent"></p>
            <h4>NAMES</h4>
            <p>Due to the natural flow of Stelkin, foreclaimers prefer names with two to three syllables, such as Gothica, Elowen, or Goddrick. Names that are overly long or short interrupt the breathing pattern used in the foreclaimer language. Foreclaimers are often named after their parents or other family members.</p>
            <p class="indent">In addition to given names, foreclaimers use last names, which indicate a foreclaimer’s role in society. While foreclaimers pass down their last names to their children, if a foreclaimer enters a different specialization or accomplishes a significant scientific discovery or notable feat, they may adopt a new last name to mark the occasion.</p>

If you do not have a charged power crystal* for more than 24 hours, your body ages rapidly over that time to the physical age you would have been had you not been augmented, and your maximum lifespan is reduced to the natural lifespan of an unaugmented foreclaimer, even if you replace your crystal later.</p>
