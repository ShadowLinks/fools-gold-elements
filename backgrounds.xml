        <description>
            <p>Your very soul is cursed. Misfortune and misery stick to you like the dung you just accidentally stepped in (again). Whenever things are going well, your curse ruins it. Whether you brought this fate upon yourself or were the hapless victim of circumstance, the curse is something you must live with. Your curse arouses fear in the superstitious, but something keeps you going. It’s up to you to find a way to lift your curse or to accept the challenges it brings to your life. Either way, a long road lies ahead.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your curse can’t be removed through ordinary means. Choose a curse and its origin from Appendix F: Curses, or create one yourself.</p>

                <li><strong>Languages:</strong> One of your choice of Abyssal, Celestial, Deep-Speech, Draconic, Infernal, Primordial, or Sylvan, and one other language</li>

            <h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
            <p>People with cursed souls are greatly influenced by the way the curse has affected their lives. Those who have mostly managed to avoid the negative consequences of their curse may live relatively happy lives, while those who have experienced many accidents and unlucky circumstances tend to be quite pessimistic about the world.</p>

            <p>You were born with innate magic that allows you to shape gold with your mind alone. Only a few are born with your gift, and though superstitious folk may accuse you of making a bargain with devils for your power, no one quite knows where the magic of gold shaping came from. Perhaps you were lucky enough to find a mentor capable of training you in the use of your gift. Or perhaps you were cared for by a noble patron who spared no expense for your education? Or maybe you fell in with those who wanted to use your skills to enrich themselves? Wherever you go, you will find people who are interested in your gift.</p>
