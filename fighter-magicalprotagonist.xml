            <p>The magical protagonist is a highly specialized fighter with the rare ability to wield the powers of hope, friendship, or love in battle. The truth of such powers has long been disputed in Ambria, but the lethal, sparkly results these glamorous warriors can produce are difficult to argue with.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Beginning when you choose this archetype at 3rd level, you are able to magically transform to prepare yourself for battle. By uttering a key phrase of your choice and drawing upon the powers of hope and friendship, you magically alter your outfit, makeup, and hairstyle to strengthen yourself for battle and gain the ability to use style points. The transformation lasts for 1 hour or until you are knocked unconscious. You can choose to end your transformation early as a bonus action, returning to your normal form. Once you transform, you can’t do so again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">How fast you transform causes an additional effect:</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Transform Dramatically Using an Action.</strong> You perform an elaborate dance or strike a powerful pose as your transformation takes place and alters your appearance. As your transformation sequence ends, shiny sparkles explode from your body to dazzle those looking at you. Each creature within 20 feet that can see you must succeed on a Charisma saving throw equal to 8 + your Charisma Modifier + your proficiency bonus, or become blinded until the end of your next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Transform Quickly Using a Bonus Action.</strong> You skip the elaborate ritual and transform without dazzling those around you.</p>
