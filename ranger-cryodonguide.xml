            <p>The frosty iguana-like cryodons grow in an unusual way, developing from babies to adults only as they learn. Young cryodons remain infants until they gain enough knowledge to grow to adulthood. As a cryodon guide, you have been entrusted with the care and protection of a young cryodon, guiding its growth. In exchange, you become infused with the cryodon’s magic, becoming a hardy protector capable of defending both your young companion and your allies. Cryodon guides have roles both as scholars and rugged defenders of their precious companions.</p>
            <p class="indent">You may have been entrusted with your cryodon companion by the Cryodon Council of Breckart, come into possession of a cryodon egg by chance or a scheme, or perhaps rescued a baby cryodon. However you and your companion met, the cryodon has decided that you are a good person to help them learn and grow. Once a cryodon guide and their companion have set out on their journey, they are not expected to return to Breckart until they have discovered something entirely unknown to the Cryodon Council.</p>

        <description>
            <p>At 3rd level, you form a mystical bond with an immature cryodon who becomes your companion. This companion uses the cryodon companion stat block.</p>
            <p class="indent">The cryodon is friendly to you and your companions. The cryodon shares your initiative count. In combat, the cryodon can only take the Dodge action and move unless you use a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. If you are incapacitated, the cryodon can take any action of its choice. Generally, young cryodons prefer not to engage in combat but support their guide in other ways and flee, hide, and protect themselves without their guide to defend them.</p>
            <p class="indent">Cryodon companions can make death saving throws. If your cryodon companion dies, it can recrystallize and be restored to life. Over the course of 1d4 days, the cryodon guide must spend at least two hours each day meditating with the seed crystal and adding water to it to allow a new ice body to form so the deceased cryodon is restored to life.</p>
            <p class="indent">Not all cryodon guides can achieve this recrystallization for their fallen companions. Those whose companions die permanently find the magic granted by their bond waning over the next 1d10 + 5 days. Such guides often renounce their former training and learn new skills or redouble their efforts to protect other cryodons.</p>

            <p>When it or another creature it can see would take damage, the cryodon fully encases itself or another willing creature of your choice that it can see within 30 feet in a ball of ice. The encased creature gains temporary hit points equal to 2d8 + your ranger level and has resistance to all damage. While encased in ice, the creature’s speed is 0, and it can’t take actions, bonus action, or reactions. The ball of ice lasts for 1 minute or for as long as the temporary hit points remain. The cryodon can also end the effect on its turn as a free action, and the creature loses the temporary hit points as the shield melts away.</p>

            <p>The cryodon can move across and climb icy surfaces without needing to make an ability check. Additionally, difficult terrain composed of ice or snow doesn’t cost it extra movement.</p>

            <p>When the cryodon dies, its body melts leaving a tiny, indestructible seed crystal. When the seed crystal is placed in at least 2 gallons of fresh water, the cryodon’s body grows back over the course of 1d4 days, returning to life with full hit points, provided another creature tends to it for at least 2 hours each day until its recrystallization is complete.</p>
