        <supports>Sacred Oath</supports>
        <description>
            <p>The Oath of Survival has been sworn by countless brave souls seeking to overcome the world’s challenges and emerge as an inspiring force even in the darkest days. The oath was first sworn by paladins opposing the forces of the goddess Generisa during her war on humanoids. Legends claim these warriors played a vital role in saving humanoids from extinction. Thanks to their many mighty deeds throughout history, these paladins have sometimes become known as Primordial Knights or the Blades of Endurance.</p>
            <p class="indent">This oath calls paladins to take a firm stance as they prepare themselves against any dangers the world throws at them. They are charged with ensuring not only their own survival but the survival of all sentient life. For better or worse, their alignments vary greatly, reflecting the needs of the moment. This oath places the necessity of survival above any concerns about what is good or evil and lawful or chaotic. Paladins of this oath will use these concepts as tools to keep people alive but discard them just as easily if a situation demands it. This has led to them gaining conflicting reputations as both selfless saviors and ruthless bullies.</p>
            <h5 class="caption">TENETS OF SURVIVAL</h5>
            <p>The tenets of the Oath of Survival emphasize adaptation and cultivating relationships to overcome the world’s fierce challenges.</p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Survive At Any Cost.</i></b>
                The survival of your allies and yourself stands above all. You must do whatever is necessary to ensure it.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Never Stop Evolving.</i></b>
                As the dangers of the world grow ever stronger, you must grow to face the threat. Stagnation is death. Train. Heal. Learn. Overcome.
            </p>
            <p class="indent">
                <b><i>Strength in Numbers. </i></b>
                True power comes from your allies. Help the weak become strong. Strengthen their bodies and spirits so you can face challenges as a united force.
            </p>

            <p>When you take this oath at 3rd level, you gain the following two Channel Divinity options.</p>
            <p class="indent"><i><strong>Never Surrender.</strong></i> When a creature you can see drops to 0 hit points, as a reaction, you can share your life force with it. The creature regains 1 hit point and gains temporary hit points equal to your current hit point total. When you lose hit points, the creature loses an equal number of its temporary hit points, and when the creature loses temporary hit points, you also lose an equal number of hit points. Hit point and temporary hit point losses from this feature do not trigger this effect; only direct damage to you or the target does. This effect lasts for 1 minute or until you are incapacitated or fall unconscious.</p>
            <p class="indent"><i><strong>Strike Together.</strong></i> You can use your Channel Divinity to harmonize your attacks with your allies. As an action, you can choose a number of creatures you can see within 60 feet of you, up to a number equal to your Charisma modifier (minimum of one creature). For 1 minute, you and the chosen creatures have advantage on attack rolls against a target if at least one of your allies is within 5 feet of the target and the ally isn’t incapacitated.</p>
