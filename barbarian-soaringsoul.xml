            <p>The Path of the Soaring Soul calls to barbarians who place deep trust in their weapons. When you take exceptional care of your weapons, you will find your weapons will also take exceptional care of you. As your bond deepens, you and your weapon will zip across the battlefield, bringing the hurt from every angle.</p>

            <p>At 3rd level when you adopt this path, choose one martial melee weapon from your equipment to become your soul-bound weapon. A rune unique to you appears on the weapon. Attacks you make with your soul-bound weapon are considered magical. Additionally, you are immune to damage from your soul-bound weapon and can sense its direction as long as you are on the same plane of existence.</p>
            <p class="indent">When you choose the Path of the Soaring Soul, you can choose to dedicate yourself to a single weapon or to gain experience with many different weapons. Choose one of the following options:</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Dedicated Soul.</strong> Your care for a single weapon allows it to grow in power along with you. Any creature other than you who attempts to wield your soul-bound weapon must first succeed on a Strength (Athletics) check with a DC equal to 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus, or be unable to lift the weapon. Additionally, your soul bound-weapon becomes a +1 weapon when you reach 6th level in this class, a +2 weapon when you reach 10th level, and a +3 weapon when you reach 14th level.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong>Wandering Soul.</strong> When you gain a level in this class, you can choose to exchange your soul-bound weapon for another or gain an additional soul-bound weapon by carrying out a ritual that takes no less than 12 hours to complete. You can have a number of soul-bound weapons equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). You consider all martial melee weapons that you have soul-bound as light and can wield them one-handed for the purpose of two weapon fighting. Additionally, you always use the larger damage die whether you wield a versatile soul-bound weapon one-handed or two-handed.</p>

            <p>At 10th level, your bond with your soul-bound weapon strengthens, improving your ranged strikes. When you make a ranged attack with your soul-bound weapon, your weapon bounces off the target and flies back to your grasp, whether the attack hits or misses. If the attack hits, you can have your soul-bound weapon to make a second ranged attack against an additional target within 10 feet of the first target before returning to you. At 14th level, when this second ranged attack also hits, your weapon can make a third ranged attack against another target within 10 feet of the second target before returning to you.</p>
