    <element name="Banjo of Exmodeus" type="Magic Item" source="Fools Gold" id="ID_HPP_FOOLS_MAGIC_ITEM_BANJO_OF_EXMODEUS">
        <description>
            <p>You have advantage on Performance skill checks made using this magic banjo.</p>
            <p class="indent">The first time you use your action to play this banjo each day, it summons a horrible monster, Exmodeus The Dread Raccoon, which magically appears in an unoccupied space within 10 feet of you. Exmodeus is a Tiny beast that otherwise uses the stats of a troll. On each of its turns, Exmodeus attacks the nearest creature it can see. If no creature is near enough to move to and attack, Exmodeus attacks the nearest object instead. After 1 hour, or if it is killed, Exmodeus disappears with a discordant twanging sound.</p>
            <p class="indent">The banjo regains the ability to summon Exmodeus each dawn.</p>

        <description>
            <p>This syringe contains a shimmering silver liquid.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i>Shapechangers.</i></strong> As an action, you can inject a creature within your reach with the liquid. If the target is unwilling, make a melee attack against it, treating the syringe as an improvised weapon. On a hit, if the target is a shapechanger, such as a werewolf or a vampire, it takes 5d8 radiant damage and instantly reverts to its original form. Additionally, on a hit a shapechanger target must succeed on a DC 15 Charisma saving throw, or it can’t assume a different form for 1 hour.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i>Cure.</i></strong> If bite b gone is injected into a creature cursed with lycanthropy for less than 24 hours, the curse is removed. The target takes no damage from the dose if it hasn’t yet transformed into its animal or hybrid form.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i>Prevention.</i></strong> If bite b gone is used on a creature that is not a shapechanger, for 8 hours the target has advantage on all saving throws made to resist lycanthropy and against being charmed and can’t rise as a vampire spawn if slain by a vampire’s bite.</p>

        <description>
            <p>This dark crimson berry has a tart flavor and transformative effects.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i>Inner Beast.</i></strong> If you consume a berry, you polymorph into a beast of the GM’s choice for 1 hour. The beast you transform into is always the same whenever you consume a berry and matches your personality. For example, a brave paladin might become a warhorse, while a scholarly wizard might become an owl.</p>
            <p class="indent">While transformed, you maintain your alignment and personality, but all your statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. You are considered a beast for the purpose of spells and other effects. If you drop to 0 hit points while transformed, you revert to your original form, remaining at 0 hit points.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i>Lycanthropes.</i></strong> Bloodmoon berries are highly poisonous to lycanthropes. If a lycanthrope such as a werebear, werewolf, or wererat consumes a berry, it must make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw, taking 8d8 poison damage on a failure or half as much damage on a success. Additionally, it reverts to its humanoid form and can’t use its shapechanger ability until it has completed a long rest.</p>

        <description>
            <p>This small cube can comfortably house a creature that you can summon to aid you.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i>Catching Creatures.</i></strong> You can use an empty box to attempt to capture a beast, elemental, dragon, monstrosity, plant, or ooze inside it. The box has no effect on other creature types. As an action, you can throw the box at a creature within 20 feet of you that you can see. The target must make a Constitution saving throw against the box’s DC (10), which is based on its rarity. If the target has half or more of its hit points remaining, it makes this saving throw with advantage. If the target has one-quarter of its hit point maximum or less, it makes the saving throw with disadvantage.</p>
            <p class="indent">On a failed saving throw, the target is sucked into the box, trapping the creature inside. While inside the box, the target is incapacitated, has total cover, and can’t be affected by spells or damaging areas of effect. The box can only hold one creature at a time.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i>Battling Creatures.</i></strong> While holding the box, you can use your action to summon the creature inside it for up to 10 minutes. The creature appears in an unoccupied space you can see within 20 feet of you. The creature acts immediately following your turn in the initiative order. If the creature is friendly to you, it follows your verbal commands to the best of its ability. If the creature is hostile to you, it can make a contested Wisdom check against your Wisdom (Animal Handling) skill. If the creature wins, it ignores your commands until the start of its next turn and takes the dodge action. The GM decides whether the creature is friendly or hostile to you.</p>
            <p class="indent">While summoned, the creature cannot willingly harm you or move more than 100 feet from you.</p>
            <p class="indent">Using your bonus action, you can recall the creature to its box. After summoning the creature, it can’t be summoned again until the next dawn.</p>

        <description>
            <p>This magic flail is made from a carnivorous plant with a bulbous head split by a row of crimson teeth attached to a wooden handle.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each time you hit a living creature with the flail for the first time on your turn, the plant bites the target, dealing an extra 1d8 piercing damage.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i>Awakening.</i></strong> While holding the flail, you can use a bonus action to speak its command word, causing the flail to become awake for 1 minute or until you speak the fail’s command word again as a bonus action.</p>
            <p class="indent">While it is awakened, the flail has a reach of 10 feet. On a hit, it deals 3d8 + 3 piercing damage or 4d8 + 3 piercing damage if the target is a living creature. If you roll a 1 on the attack roll, the flail hits you instead.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i>Planting.</i></strong> If the flail is dropped or placed on the ground while it is awake, the flail roots itself in the ground and makes attacks against a random creature within 10 feet of it at the end of your turn. The flail continues to make attacks in this way while it is awakened or until a creature other than you picks it up. A creature attempting to pick up the flail while the plant is awake must succeed on a DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check to uproot it.</p>
            <p class="indent">Once the flail has been awakened, it can’t be awakened again until the following dawn.</p>

        <description>
            <p>This magic arrow has a thin yet sturdy shaft and a fragment of yellow crystal embedded in its arrowhead. You can use an action to collapse the arrow’s telescopic shaft, reducing it to less than half its size. When collapsed, it can’t be fired, but you have advantage on Sleight of Hand checks made to conceal it. You can return the arrow to its normal size on your turn as part of your action to fire it.</p>
            <p class="indent">When fired, the arrowhead becomes charged with radiant energy. On a hit, the arrow deals a bonus 1d6 radiant damage. Additionally, the target of the attack sheds bright light in a 10-foot radius until the start of your next turn and can’t benefit from being invisible.</p>
            <p class="indent">If the arrow is retrieved after being used, its magical properties recharge after the arrow has spent at least 1 hour in direct sunlight.</p>

            <p>This sleek magical sickle is powered by a crystal on its pommel. It has the finesse property and the thrown property with a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet. When you make a ranged attack using this weapon, the weapon flies back to your hand immediately after the attack.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can use a bonus action to speak the sickle’s command word, causing its blade to become charged with radiant energy, shedding bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. While the blade is charged, it deals an extra 2d6 radiant damage to any target it hits. The blade remains charged until you use a bonus action to speak the command word again or until you drop or sheathe the sickle.</p>

            <p>This spear is fitted with mechanisms to make both a deadly weapon and a useful tool. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i>Immovable Core.</i></strong> An immovable rod is integrated into the shaft of the spear. You can use an action to press a button on the butt-end of the shaft, which causes the spear to become magically fixed in place. Until you or another creature uses an action to push the button again, the spear doesn’t move, even if it is defying gravity. The spear can hold up to 8,000 pounds of weight. More weight causes the spear to deactivate and fall. A creature can use an action to make a DC 30 Strength check, moving the fixed spear up to 10 feet on a success.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i></i></strong>Poison Chamber. The spear has a hollow chamber at the base of the blade that you can place poison vials into. You can load a potion of poison or similar poison into the chamber as an action. While a poison is loaded into the chamber, as a bonus action, you can cause the blade of the spear to become coated with poison. The poison remains for 1 minute or until an attack using this weapon hits a creature. When you hit a creature with the poison-coated blade, it takes an extra 3d6 poison damage and becomes poisoned for 1 minute. Once you have used this property, you must load another potion into the chamber before you can use it again.</p>

        <description>
            <p>This helm is part of a once-complete set of sentient armor belonging to an extra-dimensional creature called Thsklmxklmhtt. When worn, the helm can be used as a spellcasting focus.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i>Warbling Shriek.</i></strong> As a reaction, whenever a creature you can see within 60 feet of you makes a saving throw, you can subtract your proficiency bonus from the result, potentially causing the creature to fail the save. You must use this feature before the GM says whether the roll succeeds or fails. Once you use this property, you can’t use it again until the next dawn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i>Sentience.</i></strong> The helm is a sentient item of neutral evil alignment, with an Intelligence of 5, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 18. It has hearing and darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. The helm can speak Common and Deep Speech and perfectly mimic and repeat anything it has heard. The helm can walk around using its tentacles at a speed of 30 feet. It also has climb and swim speeds of 30 feet.</p>

            <p class="indent"><strong><i>Personality. </i></strong>The helm contains a small fragment of the sentience Thsklmxklmhtt possessed when it was united with the other pieces of its set. It is driven by an unceasing desire to find a wearer capable of reuniting it with the other lost pieces of the armor of Thsklmxklmhtt. When the helm chooses to communicate, it is very dramatic, though it generally stays silent and motionless, playing the part of a nonliving object until a creature has attuned to it. It allows itself to be worn by anyone, but it only allows a spellcaster it considers worthy of its power to attune to it.</p>

            <p class="indent"><strong><i></i></strong>Demon Speech. While attuned to the tattoo, you can speak, read, and write Abyssal.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i></i></strong>Demonic Sacrifice. Within the confines of Brushwick, or anotherarea with magical ties to Abrith, your tattoo allows you to summon a demon by performing a 1-minute long ritual involving sacrificing a goat. The summoned demon obeys your commands and is friendly to you. The demon remains until it is reduced to 0 hit points or until midnight, at which point it disappears in a gout of flame and returns to its original plane. If your attunement to the tattoo ends, the demon remains until it chooses to return to its original plane and will no longer obey your commands. You can only summon one demon at a time using this tattoo, and once you have summoned a demon, you can’t summon another until the following midnight.</p>
            <p class="indent">The maximum CR of a demon you can summon depends on the rarity of the tattoo. Max CR 19 and above (balor)</p>

            <p>This shard of crystal contains a fragment of the god Xanu’s shattered essence.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i>Attunement.</i></strong> Consuming or embedding the shard in your body automatically attunes you to it. If this would cause you to go above the number of items you can attune to, you must choose to end attunement to one of your currently attuned items. Alternatively, you can attune to the shard as with a normal magic item.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can only end your attunement to this item if Xanu allows you to.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i>Turn Automaton.</i></strong> The shard has 3 charges. You can use your action to expend 1 of the charges to attempt to turn constructs that are powered by soul gems. Each construct that can see or hear you within 30 feet of you must make a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. If the construct fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can’t willingly move to a space within 30 feet of you. It also can’t take reactions. For its action, it can use only the Dash action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there’s nowhere to move, the creature can use the Dodge action.</p>
            <p class="indent">The shard regains 1d3 charges each day at dawn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i>Soul Magic.</i></strong> Through Xanu’s power, you have access to the divine arcana of Soul Magic. You gain the ability to cast the following spells, based on your character level: 1-sense souls 5-soul bump 10-soulbound oath 15-purge soul</p>
            <p class="indent">You can cast each of these spells once per day without using a spell slot, using Constitution as your spellcasting ability if you do not have the ability to cast spells. If you have the spellcasting trait, you can use your spellcasting ability in place of Constitution, and each Soul Magic spell is added to the spells you know and counts as a spell of your spellcasting class. If you prepare spells, you always have the Soul Magic spells prepared, and they don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p>
            <p class="indent">If Xanu is hostile towards you, each time you cast a Soul Magic spell, it has a 25% chance of going wild. If your spell goes wild, roll on the Chaos Surges table to determine the effect.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i></i></strong>Sentience. Xanu’s alignment is lawful neutral. He has an Intelligence of 25, a Wisdom of 20, and a Charisma of 26. He has hearing and truesight out to a range of 120 feet of each of his shards. Xanu can speak, read, and understand all languages and can communicate telepathically with a creature attuned to the shard. Xanu can also choose to project an illusory image of himself to accompany his voice. Xanu appears as a foreclaimer with dark gray skin covered in glowing white lines. He may or may not be wearing cargo pants. Xanu is present in all of his shards and is aware of them all simultaneously.</p>

            <p>This spine-covered lantern was taken from the end of a hooded reaper’s tail. Strange truths are revealed within its hypnotic light.</p>
            <p class="indent">The lantern emits bright light in a 25-foot radius. This light can’t be extinguished by any means, but can be covered.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i>True Light. </i></strong>The lantern has 3 charges. As a bonus action, you can expend 1 charge to activate the lantern’s magic for 1 minute. While active, all creatures perceiving the illuminated area do so as if with truesight. The lantern regains 1d3 charges each day at dawn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i>Hypnotic Sway.</i></strong> As an action, you can wave the lantern hypnotically. Each creature that can see the lantern must succeed on a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you until the end of its next turn or until it takes damage. While charmed, a target must move up to its speed toward the lantern on each of its turns. If a creature succeeds on its saving throw or the effect ends for it, it is immune to the lantern’s Hypnotic Sway for the next 24 hours.</p>

            <p>This extremely sturdy metal shield is crafted from a watcher automaton’s faceplate. The shield has three massive horns and resembles a triceratops’ head. While holding this shield, you gain a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i>Shield Bash. </i></strong>You can use this shield as a martial weapon. It has the heavy property and deals 1d6 bludgeoning damage plus 1d6 piercing damage on a hit.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i>Charging Bash.</i></strong> If you move at least 10 feet in a straight line immediately before making an attack with this shield, on a hit you deal extra bludgeoning damage equal to your proficiency bonus and push the target 15 feet away from you</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i>Stick Around. </i></strong>You have a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this shield. If you hit a target that is adjacent to a wall or sturdy object with Charging Bash, you can forego the shield’s piercing damage to use your shield to pin it. A pinned target is restrained until the start of your next turn.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><i>Earth Shatter. </i></strong>As an action, you can slam your shield into the ground, cracking the terrain in a 10-foot-radius circle around you. Each creature in the area other than you must succeed on a DC 14 Strength saving throw or take 10 (3d6) bludgeoning damage and be knocked prone. Additionally, the area becomes difficult terrain for 1 minute.</p>
