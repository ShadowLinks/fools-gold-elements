            <p>An ethereal chain shoots forth from your chest at a creature you can see within range. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the spectral chain attaches to the target’s body, linking you both together. The chain can stretch to any distance and pass through objects, and you and the target can move away from each other beyond the casting range of the spell without ending the spell. While you are connected in this way, you and the target know each other’s location, even if you can’t see or hear one another</p>
            <p class="indent">When you take damage, the target takes the same type of damage equal to the amount of damage you take. If damage reduces you to 0 hit points, the target takes the full amount of damage that you would have taken beyond 0 hit points.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you regain hit points while under the effect of this spell, the target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the number of hit points you regained.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each time a target takes damage from this spell, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the spell on a success. If you or the target moves to a different plane of existence, the spell ends.</p>

            <p>You transport a Tiny nonmagical object through the realm of dreams to a creature known to you. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. When you finish casting the spell, the object disappears from your grasp. The next time the target goes to sleep, it dreams of you handing it the object. If the creature accepts the object in the dream, it awakens holding the object, and you are aware that the spell has been successful. If the target chooses not to accept the object, the object reappears in your hand when the target awakens.</p>
            <p class="indent">The object can be no larger than 1 foot in any dimension, can’t weigh more than 20 pounds, can’t contain any living matter, and can’t be magical. If you target a creature that doesn’t sleep, such as an elf or mohsnian, the spell fails and the object does not disappear.</p>

            <p>You touch another willing creature and replenish its magical energy. The creature gains a spell slot of 2nd level or lower that it can use to cast spells as though it were one of its own spell slots. Additionally, the target gains an effect of your choice chosen from the following options.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The target has advantage on the next spell attack it makes before the end of its next turn.</li>
                <li>One target of a spell cast by the target before the end of its next turn has disadvantage on its saving throw to resist the effect.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you increase the level of the spell slot you grant the target by 1 for every level above 3rd.</p>
            <p class="indent">This spell has no effect on creatures that can’t cast spells using spell slots.</p>

        <supports>Druid, Ranger</supports>
        <description>
            <p>With a swift stab into the ground, you instantly create a spiked pit trap centered on a point you can see. The trap can be created on any horizontal surface that is at least 10 feet wide. The trap is 10 feet wide and 10 feet deep, and it has sharp wooden stakes on the bottom.</p>
            <p class="indent">The spiked pit trap is concealed with an illusion that matches the surface the trap is on, and it remains there until triggered. A creature must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to notice the trap.</p>
            <p class="indent">When a creature steps onto the trap, the illusion vanishes and the creature falls into the pit, taking 2d10 piercing damage from the spikes plus 1d6 bludgeoning damage from its fall. Once all creatures caught in the trap leave its area or the spell ends, the trap disappears, and the ground returns to its previous state. Any corpses, objects, or creatures in the trap when the spell ends are moved up onto the surface where the spell was cast.</p>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you increase the depth of the trap by 10 feet, and the fall damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

            <p>You emanate an aura of confidence, convincing onlookers of your awesome power. Up to ten creatures of your choice within range that can see you must succeed on an Intelligence saving throw or become frightened of you until the end of your next turn. As a bonus action on your turn, you can make a Charisma (Intimidation) check against each affected target’s Wisdom (Insight) or Intelligence (Investigation) to maintain the frightened condition until the end of your next turn. A target that wins this contested check is no longer frightened and becomes immune to this spell for 1 hour.</p>
            <p class="indent">The spell ends for a target if it can no longer see you.</p>

        <description>
            <p>A beam of freezing air shoots from your hands, creating a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range that you can see. The sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.</p>
            <p class="indent">The icy fog is extremely cold, and its area is difficult terrain. A creature that starts its turn in the sphere must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 4d6 cold damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the damage increases by 1d6 and the radius increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

        <supports>Cleric, Wizard</supports>
        <description>
            <p>You draw a magical rune with the power to unleash burning agony. You inscribe the rune on an object no larger than a 10-foot cube (such as a chair, door, or treasure chest). The rune must be between 6 and 12 inches in diameter. If the object is moved more than 15 feet from where you cast this spell or the rune is damaged, the rune is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.</p>
            <p class="indent">While one or more creatures you can see are touching an object inscribed with the rune, you can use your bonus action to trigger the rune. A creature touching the object when the rune is triggered must make a Constitution saving throw, taking 7d6 fire damage on a failed saving throw, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>
            <p class="indent">After the rune is triggered, you can concentrate on the spell to extend its effects. While you concentrate on the spell, a creature that fails its initial saving throw can’t let go or move away from the item inscribed with the rune. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your subsequent turns to cause 4d6 fire damage to the creature. Each time the creature takes this damage, it can repeat its saving throw, ending the spell on a success. The spell also ends if you can no longer see the creature.</p>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can inscribe an additional rune for each spell slot above 4th on another object within 15 feet of the original target./p>
