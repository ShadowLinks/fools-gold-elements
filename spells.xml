        <description>
            <p>An ethereal chain shoots forth from your chest at a creature you can see within range. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the spectral chain attaches to the target’s body, linking you both together. The chain can stretch to any distance and pass through objects, and you and the target can move away from each other beyond the casting range of the spell without ending the spell. While you are connected in this way, you and the target know each other’s location, even if you can’t see or hear one another</p>
            <p class="indent">When you take damage, the target takes the same type of damage equal to the amount of damage you take. If damage reduces you to 0 hit points, the target takes the full amount of damage that you would have taken beyond 0 hit points.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you regain hit points while under the effect of this spell, the target gains a number of temporary hit points equal to the number of hit points you regained.</p>
            <p class="indent">Each time a target takes damage from this spell, the target can repeat the saving throw, ending the spell on a success. If you or the target moves to a different plane of existence, the spell ends.</p>

            <p>You infuse the spells of those who dare attack you with the randomness of pure chaos. The caster of the spell that triggers your reaction must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the spell goes wild, and the caster must roll on the Chaos Surge table to determine the effect. Additionally, the caster becomes glitched for one minute. While glitched, each time the caster casts a spell using a spell slot, there is a 50% chance the spell goes wild. An affected caster can repeat its saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success.</p>

When you finish casting the spell, the object disappears from your grasp. The next time the target goes to sleep, it dreams of you handing it the object. If the creature accepts the object in the dream, it awakens holding the object, and you are aware that the spell has been successful.

            <p>You bring up to eight willing creatures within range into a dreamscape you create. Targets fall asleep and benefit from a long rest if they spend at least 6 hours in the dreamscape. Creatures that don’t sleep are unaffected by this spell.</p>
            <p class="indent">You choose the appearance of the dreamscape and can alter it using an action. Creatures inside the dreamscape can interact with it as though it were real and retain their statistics and abilities. Creatures can’t sleep or rest within the dreamscape. When you wake, the dreamscape ceases to exist, and all other creatures within it wake too.</p>
            <p class="indent">Another creature can enter your dreamscape using the dream spell and can attempt to take control of it. You can resist the attempt by succeeding on a spellcasting ability check contested by the caster of the dream spell. The winner of the check has control of the dreamscape until the spell ends.</p>
            <p class="indent">All damage dealt to creatures within the dreamscape is psychic damage and doesn’t carry over to a creature’s sleeping body. If a creature within the dreamscape drops to 0 hit points, it is forced out of the dreamscape and remains unconscious for 2d6 hours as its mind heals.</p>

            <p>You touch a humanoid and attempt to trap it within a near-eternal dream state. The target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw, or it falls unconscious and remains asleep until the spell ends. While the target is unconscious, it doesn’t dream, and its body doesn’t age. It doesn’t require sustenance as long as it remains unconscious, and it has resistance to all damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">Awakening Condition. When you cast this spell, you must specify a reasonable condition that must be met for the target to awaken, such as “Awaken with a kiss of true love” or “Awaken when the scale of a red dragon is placed upon your body.” If the awakening condition is impossible or harmful to the target, the spell fails. The target can only be woken if the awakening condition is fulfilled or with a wish spell. Once the awakening condition is met, the target wakes up, remembering the dream it experienced while it was unconscious.</p>
            <p class="indent">Identification. To discern that a creature is under the effect of this spell and what the awakening condition is, a creature can cast identify on the target or must succeed on an Intelligence (Arcana) check against your spell save DC.</p>

            <p>You create a glacier on a solid surface within range. It must fit within a 150-foot cube and can’t be smaller than a 50-foot cube. The spell fails if you attempt to cast a glacier in an area that can’t physically accommodate it.</p>
            <p class="indent">Statistics. The glacier can be attacked and damaged. It has AC 15, 300 hit points, vulnerability to fire damage, and immunity to cold, poison, and psychic damage. The spell ends if the glacier is destroyed. Climbing the slippery glacier requires a successful DC 18 Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check. Creatures with a climb speed or appropriate equipment have advantage on this check.</p>
            <p class="indent">Movement. As a bonus action on each of your turns, you can move the glacier up to 30 feet in any direction. Ground the glacier travels over becomes difficult terrain.</p>
            <p class="indent">Pushing Creatures. When the glacier appears, each creature within its area is pushed out to the edge of the glacier and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 10d10 cold damage, or half as much damage on a successful save.</p>
            <p class="indent">When the glacier moves into a creature’s space, the creature is pushed out of the space by the glacier and must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failure, a creature takes 5d10 cold damage and 5d10 bludgeoning damage. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and isn’t knocked prone. A Gargantuan creature can make a Strength saving throw to resist the glacier. On a success, it is not moved and does not have to make the Constitution saving throw.</p>
            <p class="indent">Pushing Structures and Objects. If you move the glacier into a space occupied by a structure or object, the glacier deals 50 bludgeoning damage to each structure in its area, but it can’t move further into the space occupied by the structure or object until the obstacle is destroyed.</p>

        <description>
            <p>With a swift stab into the ground, you instantly create a spiked pit trap centered on a point you can see. The trap can be created on any horizontal surface that is at least 10 feet wide. The trap is 10 feet wide and 10 feet deep, and it has sharp wooden stakes on the bottom.</p>
            <p class="indent">The spiked pit trap is concealed with an illusion that matches the surface the trap is on, and it remains there until triggered. A creature must succeed on an Intelligence (Investigation) or Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to notice the trap.</p>
            <p class="indent">When a creature steps onto the trap, the illusion vanishes and the creature falls into the pit, taking 2d10 piercing damage from the spikes plus 1d6 bludgeoning damage from its fall. Once all creatures caught in the trap leave its area or the spell ends, the trap disappears, and the ground returns to its previous state. Any corpses, objects, or creatures in the trap when the spell ends are moved up onto the surface where the spell was cast.</p>
            <p class="indent">At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, you increase the depth of the trap by 10 feet, and the fall damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

While acting under the influence of this spell, a creature has no conscious awareness of its surroundings or the actions it is taking.

On a failure, a target begins farting uncontrollably, creating a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on itself filled with a pungent green gas that moves with it for the spell’s duration. Additionally, the target becomes poisoned and can only take an action, a bonus action, or move on its turn.

            <p>Your form spectral hands that push through the chest of a creature you can see within range, attempting to force its soul from its body. The target must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failure, the target’s soul is separated from its body and pushed into an unoccupied space adjacent to the target, where it can’t be interacted with for the spell’s duration. The soul is freed when the spell ends, and it can return to its body if its body has at least 1 hit point and has not been completely destroyed, petrified, or transformed into an object. If the soul can’t return to its body, it becomes a ghost.</p>
            <p class="indent">While separated from its soul, the target’s body is unconscious, immune to psychic damage, and automatically fails Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws. The target’s body can take damage and be healed as normal.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you maintain concentration on this spell for the full duration, the target’s body dies. Its body becomes a corpse, incapable of housing a soul until revived using raise dead or similar magic. You can decide whether to trap the creature’s soul in an object, destroy it, have it become a ghost, or let it pass to another plane. This spell has no effect on constructs not powered by soul crystals or on undead creatures that do not possess souls, such as zombies and skeletons.</p>

<ul>
<li>Weal, for good results</li>

<p>Three illusory duplicates of yourself appear in your space. Until the spell ends, the duplicates move with you and mimic your actions, shifting position so it’s impossible to track which image is real. You can use your action to dismiss the illusory duplicates.</p>
<p class="indent">Each time a creature targets you with an attack during the spell’s duration, roll a d20 to determine whether the attack instead targets one of your duplicates.</p>
<p class="indent">If you have three duplicates, you must roll a 6 or higher to change the attack’s target to a duplicate. With two duplicates, you must roll an 8 or higher. With one duplicate, you must roll an 11 or higher.</p>
<p class="indent">A duplicate’s AC equals 10 + your Dexterity modifier. If an attack hits a duplicate, the duplicate is destroyed. A duplicate can be destroyed only by an attack that hits it. It ignores all other damage and effects. The spell ends when all three duplicates are destroyed.</p>
<p class="indent">A creature is unaffected by this spell if it can’t see, if it relies on senses other than sight, such as blindsight, or if it can perceive illusions as false, as with truesight.</p>

<p>You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can’t create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a troglodyte’s stench).</p>
<p class="indent">As long as you are within range of the illusion, you can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range. As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly, you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even making it carry on a conversation, for example.</p>
<p class="indent">Physical interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature.</p>

<p>You make natural terrain in a 150-foot cube in range look, sound, and smell like some other sort of natural terrain. Thus, open fields or a road can be made to resemble a swamp, hill, crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn gully like a wide and smooth road. Manufactured structures, equipment, and creatures within the area aren’t changed in appearance.</p>

<p>This spell shapes a creature’s dreams. Choose a creature known to you as the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as you. Creatures that don’t sleep, such as elves, can’t be contacted by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings, but can’t take actions or move.</p>
<p class="indent">If the target is asleep, the messenger appears in the target’s dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears in the target’s dreams.</p>
<p class="indent">You can make the messenger appear monstrous and terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts the duration of the target’s sleep and prevents the target from gaining any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6 psychic damage.</p>
<p class="indent">If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail, or similar portion of the target’s body, the target makes its saving throw with disadvantage.</p>

<description>
<p>You attempt to reshape another creature’s memories. One creature that you can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target’s memories are modified.</p>
<p class="indent">While this charm lasts, you can affect the target’s memory of an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.</p>
<p class="indent">You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root. Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature’s memory isn’t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the spell ends.</p>
<p class="indent">A modified memory doesn’t necessarily affect how a creature behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature’s natural inclinations, alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect a creature in a significant manner.</p>

<p>This spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance. An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it is unaffected by this spell.</p>
<p class="indent">The spell disguises physical appearances as well as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1 foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can’t change a target’s body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.</p>
<p class="indent">The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspections. For example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature’s outfit objects pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel the creature’s head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner then you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you while it was seemingly still in midair.</p>
<p class="indent">A creature can use its action to inspect a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised.</p>

<p>When you cast this spell, you inscribe a harmful glyph either on a surface (such as a section of floor, a wall, or a table) or within an object that can be closed to conceal the glyph (such as a book, a scroll, or a treasure chest). If you choose a surface, the glyph can cover an area of the surface no larger than 10 feet in diameter. If you choose an object, that object must remain in its place; if the object is moved more than 10 feet from where you cast this spell, the glyph is broken, and the spell ends without being triggered.</p>
<p class="indent">The glyph is nearly invisible, requiring an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC to find it.</p>
<p class="indent">You decide what triggers the glyph when you cast the spell. For glyphs inscribed on a surface, the most typical triggers include touching or stepping on the glyph, removing another object covering it, approaching within a certain distance of it, or manipulating the object that holds it. For glyphs inscribed within an object, the most common triggers are opening the object, approaching within a certain distance of it, or seeing or reading the glyph.</p>
<p class="indent">You can further refine the trigger so the spell is activated only under certain circumstances or according to a creature's physical characteristics (such as height or weight), or physical kind (for example, the ward could be set to affect hags or shapechangers). You can also specify creatures that don't trigger the glyph, such as those who say a certain password.</p>
<p class="indent">When you inscribe the glyph, choose one of the options below for its effect. Once triggered, the glyph glows, filling a 60-foot-radius sphere with dim light for 10 minutes, after which time the spell ends. Each creature in the sphere when the glyph activates is targeted by its effect, as is a creature that enters the sphere for the first time on a turn or ends its turn there.</p>

<strong>
<i>Fear. </i>

<p>This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature, such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose antipathy or sympathy as the aura’s effect.</p>
<p class="indent">
<strong>
<em>Antipathy.</em>
</strong>
The enchantment causes creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened. The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to move to the nearest safe spot from which it can’t see the target. If the creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can’t see it, the creature is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it.
</p>
<p class="indent">
<strong>
<em>Sympathy.</em>
</strong>
The enchantment causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can’t willingly move away from the target.
</p>
<p class="indent">If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature, the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described below.</p>
<p class="indent">
<strong>
<em>Ending the Effect.</em>
</strong>
If an affected creature ends its turn while not within 60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected by the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the spell persists.
</p>
<p class="indent">creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again.</p>

<p>You banish a creature that you can see within range into a labyrinthine demiplane. The target remains there for the duration or until it escapes the maze.</p>
<p class="indent">The target can use its action to attempt to escape. When it does so, it makes a DC 20 Intelligence check. If it succeeds, it escapes, and the spell ends (a minotaur or goristro demon automatically succeeds).</p>
<p class="indent">When the spell ends, the target reappears in the space it left or, if that space is occupied, in the nearest unoccupied space.</p>

<description>
<p>You and up to eight willing creatures within range project your astral bodies into the Astral Plane (the spell fails and the casting is wasted if you are already on that plane). The material body you leave behind is unconscious and in a state of suspended animation; it doesn’t need food or air and doesn’t age. </p>
<p class="indent">Your astral body resembles your mortal form in almost every way, replicating your game statistics and possessions. The principal difference is the addition of a silvery cord that extends from between your shoulder blades and trails behind you, fading to invisibility after 1 foot. This cord is your tether to your material body. As long as the tether remains intact, you can find your way home. If the cord is cut—something that can happen only when an effect specifically states that it does—your soul and body are separated, killing you instantly. </p>
<p class="indent">Your astral form can freely travel through the Astral Plane and can pass through portals there leading to any other plane. If you enter a new plane or return to the plane you were on when casting this spell, your body and possessions are transported along the silver cord, allowing you to re-enter your body as you enter the new plane. Your astral form is a separate incarnation. Any damage or other effects that apply to it have no effect on your physical body, nor do they persist when you return to it. </p>
<p class="indent">The spell ends for you and your companions when you use your action to dismiss it. When the spell ends, the affected creature returns to its physical body, and it awakens.</p>
<p class="indent">The spell might also end early for you or one of your companions. A successful dispel magic spell used against an astral or physical body ends the spell for that creature. If a creature’s original body or its astral form drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends for that creature. If the spell ends and the silver cord is intact, the cord pulls the creature’s astral form back to its body, ending its state of suspended animation.</p>
<p class="indent">If you are returned to your body prematurely, your companions remain in their astral forms and must find their own way back to their bodies, usually by dropping to 0 hit points.</p>

<p>Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion calls on the creature’s deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares as an implacable threat. At the end of each of the frightened creature’s turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature.</p>
