            <p>The Circle of Swiftness was an ancient order of druids that was thought to be lost to time until a powerful druid named Gothi, the last surviving member of this circle, shared its teachings with other druids of Ambria and slowly revived the circle’s popularity.</p>
            <p class="indent">The circle’s teachings aim to deepen a druid’s bond with an animal companion by fighting together as one to protect the balance of nature.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Starting at 2nd level, you form a bond with a wild beast that becomes your companion mount. Your mount can take the form of any beast, but it uses the companion mount stat block, possibly altering its physical characteristics beyond the norms for a creature of its kind. You choose how your mount attacks and what kind of damage this attack deals when you bond with it. For example, if your mount is a sharkhound, its attack could be a bite that does piercing damage, but if you decide it is a massive fluffy rabbit, its attack could instead be a kick that does bludgeoning damage.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your mount is friendly to you and your companions, and it has its own distinct personality.</p>
            <p class="indent">In combat, your mount shares your initiative count and takes its turn directly after yours, though it can only take the Dodge action and move unless you use your bonus action to command it to take a different action, such as attacking, hiding, or interacting with an object. If you are incapacitated, your mount can take any action of its choice, not just Dodge.</p>
            <p class="indent">As part of your movement each turn, you can spend half your movement speed to either mount or dismount your mount. While you are mounted, your companion mount acts on the same turn in initiative as you and can only move unless you direct it to take another action. You fall off your mount if you are incapacitated or knocked prone.</p>
            <p class="indent">While you are mounted on your companion mount, you can redirect any attacks made against your mount to target you instead, and you can use your reaction to grant your mount advantage on Strength and Dexterity saving throws.</p>
            <p class="indent">Your mount can make death saving throws. If your mount dies, you can bond with a new companion mount by performing an eight-hour ritual to commune with the spirit of another beast. Mounts can also be resurrected using magic such as revivify or resurrection.</p>
            <p class="indent">You can’t have more than one companion mount at one time. If you form a bond with a new companion mount, your bond with your current companion mount is broken.</p>

            <p class="indent"><strong>Bond of Brambles.</strong> While the mount is within 5 feet of you and you are mounted on it or have assumed its form using Twin Beast Shape, terrain within 10 feet of your mount grows thick grasping brambles.
