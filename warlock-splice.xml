        <description>
            <p class="indent">You have made a pact with a patron from beyond the Material Plane known as the Splicer. The Splicer is obsessed with achieving perfection through change, but its idea of perfection is otherworldly and hard to understand. Each warlock interprets this drive toward  perfection in a different way. Making a pact with the Splicer means evoting your life to attempting to achieve an impossible level of perfection, changing yourself and the world around you to match your patron’s alien desires.</p>

            <p>Starting at 1st level, your patron grants you an extraordinary level of control over your physical form—your body is a temple, and that temple is dedicated to the Splicer. You are immune to any spell or effect that would alter your form unless you willingly allow it. Additionally, your hit point maximum increases by 1 and increases by 1 again whenever you gain a level in this class.</p>

            <p>From 6th level, your patron encourages you to transform yourself, taking the best features of other creatures and adding these traits to your own body.

The creature can be alive or dead, but corpses older than 5 days will ave decayed too much to provide useful material. Once the ritual is complete, you must specify how your body has changed. You can have a number of anatomical alterations equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum of 1). You can only obtain each  alteration once.</p>
